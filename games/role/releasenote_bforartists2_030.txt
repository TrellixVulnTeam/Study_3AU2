The Bforartists 2 alpha 0.3.0 release continues with cleaup work after the big merge of 2.80 into Bforartists. It comes also with first improvements in the original Blender 2.80 UI. Like lots of improved tooltips. A few things are at a different position now. We have started to remove double menu entries again, added menu entries for hotkey only functionality and added again quite a few missing and new icons.
